Repo for team

## Getting started

Clone the repo and run the following commands

Install dependencies
```sh
  npm i
```

```sh
  npm run start:dev
```


You should now have the server running on localhost:3000. When you change source code, webpack should rebuild and nodemon will run the new code without needing to restart the server.

## deploying

Simply open a pr and when it is merged the CD pipeline will deploy the change
